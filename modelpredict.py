            age: (int): Number of years since car is bought.
            transmission (str): 'Manual' or 'Automatic': Default is 'Manual'
            owner (str): 'First' or 'Second' or 'Third'. Default is 'First'
            seats (int): Number of seats. Default is 4.
            make (str): Currently it supports only 'maruti' or 'hyundai'. Default is 'maruti'.
            model (str): 'alto' or 'swift' or 'desire' or 'zen'. Default is 'swift'
            mileage (float): Mileage of the car in km per liter. Default is 10.0
            engine (float): Engine capacity of the car in cc. Default is 800.0 cc.
            power (float): Power of the car in bhp. Default is 85.0 bhp. 
            location (str): Which location the car is available for the sell. 'Bangalore' or 'Hyderabad' or 'Mumbai' or 'Chennai'. Default is 'Bangalore'
            
          
        Returns:
            float: The expected sale price of the car in INR Lakhs. For example, 8.5 means the car is expected to be sold at INR 8.5 lakhs.
